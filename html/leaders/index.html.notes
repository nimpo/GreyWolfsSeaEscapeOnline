      <h1>Grey Wolf's Sea Escape</h1>
      <h2>Notes for leaders</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the leaders portal. Should you wish to make use of the online components of this Sea Escape, you will find a link at the end of this page to register your group/section.</p>
      <p>This online version follows the same general pattern as the <a href="/offline/">mostly offline version</a>. You are free to print out and use the offline media which I have licenced under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence</a>.</p>
      <p>There are five puzzles to solve. They can be done in small groups or as individuals. Four of the five puzzles have six slightly different questions and correspondingly different answers. This should allow groups to separate into six teams/patrols and should help discourage sneeky looks at one another's answers. If scouts are solving these as indivituals then distribute the 6 question sets as you see fit amongst your scouts.</p>
      <p>The 6 question sets are labelled: 1, Black; 2, Yellow; 3, Silver; 4, Blue; 5, Purple; 6, Pink. The numbers are important to know as some puzzles rely on them, the colours are the original colours of the locks in my offline rendering of this escape room.</p>
      <p>The puzzles mostly lead to a 3 digit code (originally to unlock a chest with a padlock of their team's colours hidden about the precincts of the scout hut). These are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Where's Jack:</b>The scouts are on radio watch and need to note down Cptn Jack's location from an overheard distress broadcast: once they have this they need to use a supplied googlemap to pan and zoom to his location. Once they find him they can progress to the next puzzle. (You will place a tiny Black Pearl, on the map during setup. This can be accurate to a hundredth of a second: enough to hide him on your grounds!)</li>
        <li><b>The Siren's Score:</b> It's a musical aside, (also online), for variety and to encorage others within the team. Leads to a three digit code.</li>
        <li><b>Bearings Away:</b> Use the online map and plotter, or offline map and construct the plotter to get a three digit code from the clue.</li>
        <li><b>Transits:</b>(Sorry, I can't think of a good pun) Using the map again to get a three digit code.</li>
        <li><b>Queen of the Seas:</b>A chess Buoyage rule mashup leads to a three digit code.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For the offline version I hid instructions for each puzzle within mini-chests, locked with coded padlocks, placed in locations described in terms of maritime vocabulary: as if the scout hut was a boat and had a bow and stern. I also left a glossary of terms (link/citation required) and various nautical references to help solve the problems set.</p>

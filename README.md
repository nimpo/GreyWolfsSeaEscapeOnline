You'll need sox, perl, bash, apache2.4, php, a domain and ssl to make this work.
You'll need to place etc/seascouts.conf into your apache sites-enables area (if ubuntuish).
You'll need to configure said etc/seascouts.conf as aproprate to your server.
This setup is designed for me to attempt to gain some revinue to maintain the service. You'll need to set up somthing for yourselves; but I would apreciate you keep the revinue streams I have set for the running of the original.
